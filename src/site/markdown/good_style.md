# Good Style Guide

## Code Comments

- Comments should be short and easy to understand.
- Explain why something is done, not only what is done.
- Use English for all comments in the code.
- Avoid unnecessary comments for very simple code.

## Example:

```java
// Calculate the factorial of a number
public int factorial(int n) {
    ...
}
```

## Git Commit Messages
- Write short and meaningful messages.

- Use the imperative form (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update").

-  Write messages in English.

-  Keep the message under 50 characters if possible.

Example:

```
add javadoc comments to calculator class
fix division by zero error
update pom.xml with maven site plugin
```
